- Dinge vom Herzen machen
- Glücklichsein zulassen

Coldplay: Christmas Lights --> Weihnachtsbild
Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on

Florence and the machine: Spectrum --> Kapuzen
Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Swedish House Mafia: Don't you worry child --> Polarlichter mit uns
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now, yeah

Florence and the machine: Shake It Out --> Fusion
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off

Marshmellow: Silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

Queen: Don't stop me now --> 
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call

Queen: Don't stop me now --> 
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call

Coldplay: Paradise --> Vigo
